# Test Automation project for Navigator.ba and abhShoes

**Test Objective**

Test objective for Navigator.ba and abhShoes is to test functionality, usability, performance, user interface and accuracy of output results.
Both are treated as a black box, meaning that internal structure and source code are not be considered and tested.

**Scope of testing**

Testing of Navigator.ba and abhShoes applications address functionality, responsiveness, user interface and accuracy of information given as output result. Also, some proposed improvements are discussed. Both desktop and mobile version of Navigator.ba application are tested.

**Test deliverables**

In the period before testing master test plan is created along with test cases and smoke test.
After testing is done, full bug and improvements report is written. Also, demo presentation with an overview of entire testing process for both applications is created and delivered in front of Management.

**Testing type**

Testing of these applications starts with exploratory testing, followed by creation of test cases, smoke test, system test and regression test. Smoke and regression tests will also have automated versions, i.e. test scripts will be made. Considering the fact that Navigator.ba is a complete product, the aim is to inspect basic functionalities and make sure that no new bugs were introduced. For abhShoes which is still being worked on, the goal is to detect bugs, make sure no new bugs were introduced and suggest improvements.
